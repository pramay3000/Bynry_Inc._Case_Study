 Integration of Consumer Data into SMART360

Overview:

This project involves the integration of consumer data from ABC Utility Company's databases into the SMART360 platform. SMART360 is a utility management platform developed by Bynry, designed to streamline consumer data management processes. By integrating consumer data into SMART360, ABC Utility Company aims to enhance operational efficiency and improve data management workflows.

Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to develop Python scripts for automating the data integration process. The scripts will extract consumer data from ABC Utility Company's databases, map it to corresponding tables within the SMART360 platform, perform necessary transformations, and load the data into SMART360. The automation of this process will ensure data accuracy, consistency, and streamline consumer data management workflows.

Approach:

The approach to be tested involves the following steps:
1. Data Extraction: Develop Python scripts to extract consumer data from ABC Utility Company's databases.
2. Data Mapping: Map the extracted consumer data to corresponding tables within the SMART360 platform.
3. Transformation and Loading: Transform the extracted data according to SMART360 requirements and load it into the platform.
4. Validation and Testing: Thoroughly validate and test the integrated consumer data to ensure its accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
5. Deployment: Deploy the Python scripts for automated data integration and set up scheduled tasks or triggers for execution.

Directory Structure:

scripts: Contains Python scripts for data extraction, mapping, transformation, and loading.
documentation: Includes documentation files such as data mapping plan, mapping process documentation
